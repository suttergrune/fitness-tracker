# Fitness Tracker

This is a web application for tracking fitness progress. A new user can enter his or her information in the "NEW USER" section. Upon clicking Submit, an account is created with the user's information. If the user wishes to check his or her fitness progress at a later date, he or she can visit the "RETURNING USER" section. After entering the up-to-date information and clicking Submit, the user's fitness progress (or lack thereof) is displayed according to the last time they visited. This application uses JavaScript, [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com), and a [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) database.
